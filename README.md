# Drow Translator Azure Function

An Azure Function that translates text between English (Common) and the Drow language. This project is inspired by a 2003 Perl script by Brian Sidharta, focusing on translating English to Drow and vice versa using an SQLite database for the word list.

## Features

- Translate text from English to Drow and from Drow to English.
- Handles plurals, possessives, and contractions.
- Utilizes an SQLite database for efficient word lookup.
- Returns plain text responses for easy integration with applications like Second Life scripts.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure Functions Core Tools** (for local development and testing)
- **SQLite** (to manage the database file)
- **NuGet Packages**:
  - `Humanizer.Core` (for pluralization and singularization)
  - `System.Data.SQLite` (for SQLite database access)
